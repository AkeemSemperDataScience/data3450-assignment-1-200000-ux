# BSIP_Assignment_1_Students

Student starting point for assignment 1 in Akeem's stats class. Clone this repository that you started through the GitHub Education link from the assignment link.

## Testing

There is a sample test file called test_as1.py that you can use to test your functions. You can run this from the command line with:

```bash
pytest test_as1.py
```

It also runs when you push to GitHub, so you can see if your code is working there as well. You need to write the tests yourself, but there are some examples in the test file to get you started. 

When this is checked, I'll replace this with a more complete test file and run it to test the functionality part.
